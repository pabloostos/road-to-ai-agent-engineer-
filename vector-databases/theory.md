## 1. Introduction

Welcome to today's 30-minute masterclass on Vector Databases, focusing on connecting to Pinecone and uploading basic embeddings.

Vector databases are becoming a core building block in modern AI applications, especially those involving semantic search, recommendation engines, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

**By the end of this session, you will:**

- Understand the theory behind vector databases and embeddings.
- Learn how to generate embeddings and store them in Pinecone.
- Execute a practical similarity search workflow.
- Apply best practices for performance and cost efficiency.

## 2. What is a Vector Database?

A vector database stores high-dimensional vectors that represent data (text, images, audio, etc.) in a numerical form suitable for similarity search.

### How it works

1. **Embedding:** Transform your data into vectors (arrays of numbers) that capture semantic meaning.
2. **Indexing:** Organize these vectors in a way that makes similarity search fast (e.g., HNSW graph).
3. **Querying:** Input a query, embed it into a vector, and find the most similar stored vectors based on a distance metric (cosine similarity, dot product, Euclidean distance).

---

## 3. Why They Matter in Modern AI

- **Semantic Search** — Search for meaning, not keywords.
- **Recommendation Systems** — Suggest products or content based on similarity.
- **RAG Pipelines** — Improve LLM answers by retrieving relevant context.
- **Anomaly Detection** — Identify unusual patterns in numerical representations.

**Example:** Instead of searching "AI law" literally, a vector search finds documents about "machine learning regulations" because the concepts are semantically close.

## 4. Embeddings and Similarity

### Embeddings

- Numerical vectors representing the meaning of data.
- **Example:** OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 → 1,536 dimensions.
- Generated by neural networks trained on massive datasets.

### Vector Similarity

Common similarity metrics:

- **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the angle between vectors (scale-invariant).
- **Dot Product:** Measures magnitude and direction overlap.
- **Euclidean Distance:** Straight-line distance in vector space.

## 5. Indexing Methods

Efficient indexing is crucial for performance at scale.

- **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** — Graph-based search, great for fast lookups.
- **IVF (Inverted File Index)** — Clusters vectors into "buckets" for faster scanning.
- **Flat Index** — Brute force, best for small datasets.

---

## 6. Real-World Use Cases

- **E-commerce:** "People who bought X also bought Y."
- **Legal Tech:** Retrieve similar case laws.
- **Customer Support:** AI agents fetch related FAQs.
- **Healthcare:** Search for similar patient records.

## 7. Practical Walkthrough: Pinecone

### Step 1 — Install dependencies

```bash
pip install openai pinecone-client
```

### Step 2 — Import libraries & authenticate

```python
import openai
import pinecone
import os

# Set keys (replace with your own)
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
pinecone.init(api_key=os.getenv("PINECONE_API_KEY"), environment="us-west1-gcp")
```

### Step 3 — Create a Pinecone index

```python
index_name = "demo-index"

if index_name not in pinecone.list_indexes():
    pinecone.create_index(index_name, dimension=1536, metric="cosine")

index = pinecone.Index(index_name)
```

### Step 4 — Generate embeddings

```python
texts = ["Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning", "Deep Learning"]

embeddings = [
    openai.Embedding.create(input=text, model="text-embedding-ada-002")["data"][0]["embedding"]
    for text in texts
]
```

### Step 5 — Upload to Pinecone

```python
vectors = [(str(i), embeddings[i], {"text": texts[i]}) for i in range(len(texts))]
index.upsert(vectors)
```

### Step 6 — Query similar items

```python
query = "Neural Networks"
query_embedding = openai.Embedding.create(input=query, model="text-embedding-ada-002")["data"][0]["embedding"]

results = index.query(vector=query_embedding, top_k=2, include_metadata=True)
print(results)
```

## 8. Best Practices

- **Schema Design:** Store metadata alongside vectors.
- **Index Optimization:** Choose metric wisely based on your similarity needs.
- **Batch Inserts:** Upload vectors in batches to reduce API calls.
- **Cost Management:** Use smaller embeddings when possible; prune stale data.
- **Security:** Restrict API keys and manage access controls.
