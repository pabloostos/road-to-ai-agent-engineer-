# Exercise: Building a Simple Vector Search System with Pinecone

## Objective
Build a complete vector search system that demonstrates:
1. **Embedding generation** using OpenAI
2. **Vector storage** in Pinecone
3. **Similarity search** functionality
4. **Real-world application** with a knowledge base

---

## Requirements
- **OpenAI API Key** - For generating embeddings
- **Pinecone API Key** - For vector storage
- **Libraries:** `openai`, `pinecone-client`, `python-dotenv`
- **Concepts:** Vector embeddings, similarity search, metadata storage

---

## Exercise: AI Knowledge Base Search System

### Scenario
You're building a search system for an AI knowledge base. Users can search for AI-related concepts and get semantically similar results, even if they don't use exact keywords.

### Step 1: Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key_here
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_environment_here
```

### Step 2: Implement the Vector Search System

Create a class `VectorSearchSystem` with these methods:

#### `__init__(self, index_name: str = "ai-knowledge-base")`
- Initialize Pinecone connection
- Create or connect to an index
- Set up OpenAI for embeddings

#### `add_documents(self, documents: list)`
- Convert documents to embeddings
- Store vectors with metadata in Pinecone
- Handle batch operations efficiently

#### `search(self, query: str, top_k: int = 3)`
- Convert query to embedding
- Search for similar vectors
- Return ranked results with metadata

#### `get_index_stats(self)`
- Display index statistics
- Show total vectors and metadata

### Step 3: Sample Data

Use this AI knowledge base data:
```python
ai_documents = [
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn without explicit programming.",
    "Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns.",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps computers understand and generate human language.",
    "Computer Vision enables machines to interpret and analyze visual information.",
    "Reinforcement Learning teaches agents to make decisions through trial and error.",
    "Neural Networks are computing systems inspired by biological brain structures.",
    "Data Science combines statistics, programming, and domain expertise to extract insights.",
    "Big Data refers to extremely large datasets that require special processing techniques.",
    "Cloud Computing provides on-demand access to computing resources over the internet."
]
```

### Step 4: Test Queries

Test your system with these queries:
```python
test_queries = [
    "How do computers learn?",
    "What is neural network?",
    "Image recognition technology",
    "Teaching machines to make decisions",
    "Large datasets processing"
]
```

## Expected Implementation Structure

```python
import openai
import pinecone
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from typing import List, Dict, Any

class VectorSearchSystem:
    def __init__(self, index_name="ai-knowledge-base"):
        """Initialize the vector search system"""
        pass
    
    def add_documents(self, documents: List[str]):
        """Add documents to the vector database"""
        pass
    
    def search(self, query: str, top_k: int = 3) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search for similar documents"""
        pass
    
    def get_index_stats(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get index statistics"""
        pass

# Usage Example
system = VectorSearchSystem()
system.add_documents(ai_documents)

# Search for similar content
results = system.search("How do computers learn?")
for result in results:
    print(f"Score: {result['score']:.3f}")
    print(f"Text: {result['metadata']['text']}")
    print("---")
```
