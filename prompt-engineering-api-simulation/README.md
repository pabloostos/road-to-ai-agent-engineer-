# Prompt Engineering for API Simulation

## Overview

This module focuses on prompt engineering techniques for simulating API responses and creating realistic AI interactions. You'll learn how to design prompts that generate structured, consistent, and contextually appropriate responses.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand API simulation concepts and use cases
- Design prompts for consistent character responses
- Create structured output formats
- Implement error handling and validation
- Build realistic conversation flows

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd prompt-engineering-api-simulation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

4. **Run exercises**
   ```bash
   python src/exercise_1.py
   ```

## API Setup

This module uses Hugging Face Inference API for demonstrations. You'll need:

- Hugging Face account
- API key with inference permissions
- Environment variables configured

## Exercises

- **Exercise 1**: Basic API Simulation
- **Exercise 2**: Structured Response Generation
- **Exercise 3**: Conversation Flow Management
- **Exercise 4**: Error Handling and Validation
- **Exercise 5**: Production-Ready API Simulation
