- Implement consistency validation techniques
- Analyze model behavior under different temperature settings
- Create automated quality assessment tools
- Practice systematic evaluation methodologies

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

- OpenRouter API access
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages: `requests`, `json`, `statistics`, `matplotlib` (optional for visualization)

## üìö Exercise Overview

### Exercise 1: Basic Consistency Testing
Test model responses to identical prompts with different temperature settings.

### Exercise 2: Semantic Similarity Analysis
Compare responses to similar but not identical prompts to assess semantic consistency.

### Exercise 3: Quality Metrics Implementation
Implement automated metrics for evaluating response quality.

### Exercise 4: Comprehensive Evaluation Framework
Build a complete evaluation system that combines multiple assessment methods.

## üéØ Detailed Instructions

### Exercise 1: Basic Consistency Testing

**Objective**: Test how consistent the model is when given the same prompt multiple times.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a function that calls OpenRouter API with the same prompt multiple times
2. Test with temperature = 0 (deterministic) and temperature = 0.7 (non-deterministic)
3. Compare response variations and calculate consistency scores
4. Generate a report showing consistency metrics

**Expected Output**:
- Consistency percentage for each temperature setting
- Response variations analysis
- Statistical measures (mean, standard deviation)

### Exercise 2: Semantic Similarity Analysis

**Objective**: Evaluate how well the model handles similar prompts.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a set of semantically similar prompts
2. Generate responses for each prompt
3. Implement similarity scoring between responses
4. Analyze semantic consistency across variations

**Expected Output**:
- Similarity scores between responses
- Semantic consistency analysis
- Recommendations for prompt optimization

### Exercise 3: Quality Metrics Implementation

**Objective**: Implement automated quality assessment metrics.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement response length analysis
2. Create coherence evaluation functions
3. Build relevance scoring mechanisms
4. Develop faithfulness checking tools

**Expected Output**:
- Quality scores for each response
- Automated quality reports
- Comparative analysis across different prompts

### Exercise 4: Comprehensive Evaluation Framework

**Objective**: Build a complete evaluation system.

**Tasks**:
1. Combine all previous exercises into a unified framework
2. Create configurable evaluation parameters
3. Implement batch testing capabilities
4. Generate comprehensive evaluation reports

**Expected Output**:
- Complete evaluation framework
- Configurable testing system
- Detailed quality reports
- Recommendations for model optimization
