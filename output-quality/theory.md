# Evaluation of Output Quality in LLMs: Theory

## 1. Introduction

Evaluating the output quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical aspect of building reliable AI systems. It ensures that the model's responses meet the desired expectations of accuracy, consistency, and usefulness. In this lecture, we will cover theoretical frameworks, practical techniques, and real-world examples to assess and validate LLM performance.

## 2. Key Evaluation Concepts

### a. Accuracy

Measures whether the output is factually correct. It is especially important in knowledge-based tasks like question answering and summarization.

### b. Relevance

Assesses whether the response addresses the prompt appropriately. In customer support bots, for instance, responses should directly respond to user queries.

### c. Coherence

Evaluates the logical flow of information. A coherent response should make sense from beginning to end and maintain internal logic.

### d. Faithfulness

Ensures the output does not hallucinate information. For example, in summarization, the content should reflect only the input text.

### e. Consistency

Tests whether the model responds in a stable and predictable way across repeated or similar inputs.

## 3. Evaluation Techniques

### a. Automated Metrics

- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: Measures n-gram overlap between generated text and reference text.
- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**: Useful for summarization; evaluates recall-based overlaps.
- **BERTScore**: Uses contextual embeddings to compute similarity, offering deeper semantic understanding.

### b. Manual Evaluation

- **Human Judgment**: Annotators assess quality based on predefined criteria like fluency, adequacy, and informativeness.
- **Likert Scales**: Rating scales (e.g., 1 to 5) to evaluate different quality aspects.

### c. Programmatic Checks

- Rule-based tests
- Prompt-based re-evaluation
- Consistency and variability checks using scripting

## 4. Consistency Validation in Practice

### Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic Behavior

- **Deterministic setting**: Temperature = 0 (model gives the same output every time)
- **Non-deterministic setting**: Temperature > 0 (model samples from probability distribution)

Consistency is key when reproducibility or reliability is needed. For instance, legal or medical applications require strict consistency.

## 5. Real-World Examples

- **Chatbots**: Ensure that answers to repeated questions are consistent and aligned with brand tone.
- **Summarizers**: Maintain factual consistency when generating summaries from different parts of a document.
- **AI Agents**: Evaluate if agent actions and dialogue remain coherent and aligned with goals over time.

## 6. Best Practices

- Define clear evaluation goals (e.g., faithfulness over creativity)
- Use multiple evaluation methods (automated + human)
- Script consistency checks early in the dev cycle
- Regularly benchmark with golden datasets

## Conclusion

Evaluating LLM outputs is a multi-faceted challenge that combines metrics, human intuition, and scripting. Quality control not only boosts trust in AI but is also critical for deploying LLMs in real-world workflows.

In the next part, we will implement a practical exercise where you will write a Python script to validate model consistency.
