## 🛍 Why This Topic Matters

As AI becomes deeply embedded in business operations, **prompt engineering is evolving from a technical curiosity into a core business skill**. Whether it's triaging support tickets, analyzing customer sentiment, automating lead generation, or synthesizing internal reports, **well-crafted prompts** are now powering automation across every department.

Mastering business workflow prompts allows AI engineers and consultants to **bridge the gap between natural language input and structured output**, turning LLMs into functional tools that support enterprise efficiency.

## 🧠 What Are Business Workflow Prompts?

Business workflow prompts are **carefully constructed instructions** that guide a language model to produce actionable outputs aligned with enterprise tasks. These outputs are often designed to:

* Trigger API calls
* Generate structured summaries
* Draft communications (emails, replies)
* Automate repetitive analysis
* Classify or extract business-critical data

### 🎯 Characteristics

| Feature           | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal-Oriented     | Focused on producing outcomes (not open-ended text)   |
| Domain-Specific   | Tailored to business functions (Sales, HR, Ops, etc.) |
| Format-Conscious  | Often outputs in JSON, CSV, or Markdown               |
| Integration-Ready | Designed to feed directly into tools or APIs          |

## 🛡 Design Principles

### 1. **Goal Alignment**

Always clarify the business intent. Is it to summarize, classify, escalate, recommend, or trigger a tool?

**Example:**

> "Summarize the following support ticket and assign a severity level from 1 to 5."

### 2. **Context Preservation**

Include all necessary input data (raw logs, prior messages, customer info) and ensure temporal or task context is preserved.

**Example:**

> "Using the following customer chat transcript, draft a reply that answers all questions and offers a discount."

### 3. **Structured Output**

Favor formats that can be parsed or used by systems (JSON, Markdown tables, bullet lists). Define the expected schema when needed.

**Example:**

> "Return a JSON object with fields: `customerName`, `issueType`, `urgency`, and `suggestedNextStep`."

### 4. **Integration Readiness**

Design with downstream tools in mind (e.g., CRM, helpdesk, analytics platforms). Prompts should generate clean, minimal, deterministic output.

**Tip:**

> Use delimiters (`###`, ```json) to separate AI output from formatting artifacts.

## 💡 Examples by Business Function

### 📨 Example 1 — Support Ticket Classifier

**Prompt:**

```
You are an AI assistant for a support team.  
Classify the following ticket into one of these categories: ["Billing", "Technical", "Account", "Other"].  
Also assign a severity score from 1 (low) to 5 (critical).  
Output in JSON format.

Ticket:
"My account was charged twice this month and I can't reach anyone on the phone!"
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "category": "Billing",
  "severity": 4
}
```

---

### 📞 Example 2 — Lead Scoring Agent

**Prompt:**

```
You are a sales AI reviewing a potential customer.  
Based on the description, assign a lead score from 0–100 and summarize the opportunity.

Description:  
"ACME Corp is a mid-sized logistics firm. They're interested in optimizing their last-mile delivery system using AI routing. They have a €500k innovation budget."

Return a Markdown summary and numeric lead score.
```

**Expected Output:**

```markdown
### Opportunity Summary
- Company: ACME Corp
- Industry: Logistics
- Interest: AI routing for last-mile delivery
- Budget: €500k

**Lead Score:** 87
```

### 🧠 Example 3 — HR Resume Screening

**Prompt:**

```
You are an AI recruiter.  
Analyze the following resume and determine if the candidate fits the role of "Senior Data Analyst".  
Return a JSON object with keys: `isQualified` (true/false), `yearsExperience`, `keySkills`, and `redFlags`.

Resume: [Insert resume here]
```
