### Test 1

**Input:** My order hasn't arrived yet and I'm very frustrated

**Response:** I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling frustrated about your order not arriving yet. I understand how disappointing this can be. Here are some steps you can take to address the situation:

1. **Check the Order Status**: Log in to the retailer's website or app and see if there's any update on your order status. Sometimes, there might be a delay due to shipping or processing.

2. **Review the Expected Delivery Date**: Remember that delivery times can sometimes be extended due to unforeseen circumstances like weather, holidays, or high demand.

3. **Contact Customer Service**: Reach out to the retailer's customer service. They can provide more specific information about your order and may be able to help resolve any issues.

4. **Check for Notifications**: Look for any emails, text messages, or notifications from the retailer regarding your order. They might have sent an update that you missed.

5. **Be Polite but Firm**: When contacting customer service, explain your situation calmly but firmly. This will help them assist you more effectively.

6. **Ask for a Refund or Reshipment**: If the delay is unacceptable or the order is lost, you might want to request a refund or a reshipment, depending on the retailer's policy.

If you'd like, you can share the name of the retailer and any specific details about your order, and I can try to provide more tailored advice. I hope your order arrives soon or that you get a satisfactory resolution!

### Test 2

**Input:** The product I received is defective and doesn't work

**Response:** I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your product. Here's how you can proceed:

1. **Check the Warranty**: Review the manufacturer's warranty to understand your rights and the steps you need to take.

2. **Contact Customer Support**: Reach out to the company's customer service. They should be able to guide you through the return or replacement process. Here's a suggested script you can use:
   "Hello, I recently received [Product Name] and unfortunately, it's defective and not working as expected. I'd like to request a replacement/return under the warranty. Could you please guide me through the process?"

3. **Keep Records**: Maintain records of your purchase and any communication with the company. This includes receipts, order confirmations, and any emails or notes from customer service interactions.

4. **Return/Replacement**: Follow the company's instructions for returning the product or getting a replacement. Some companies may provide a prepaid return label, while others may require you to send it back at your own cost (which will be reimbursed later).

5. **Be Patient**: While you might be inconvenienced, try to remain patient and polite during the process. This can help ensure that the company assists you more promptly and effectively.

If you're unable to resolve the issue with the company directly, you may want to consider reaching out to the platform where you purchased the item (if different from the manufacturer) or a consumer protection agency in your country.

Would you like help finding the contact information for the manufacturer or the platform where you purchased the item?
