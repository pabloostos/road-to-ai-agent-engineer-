# Masterclass: Planning and Task Decomposition in AI Agents

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Level:** Advanced (AI Engineering)

## 1. Introduction (5 minutes)

Welcome to today's lecture on **Planning and Task Decomposition in AI Agents**. This topic lies at the core of creating autonomous and efficient systems capable of reasoning, organizing, and executing complex goals.

### What Are Planning and Reasoning in AI?

- **Reasoning**: The process by which an agent evaluates available information and determines logical steps to achieve a goal.
- **Planning**: The systematic generation of a sequence of actions or subtasks that leads to goal achievement.

In short:
- **Reasoning** = Thinking process
- **Planning** = Structured roadmap of actions

## 2. Why Planning Matters in AI Agents (5 minutes)

- Modern AI agents aim to autonomously complete multi-step tasks.
- Planning allows:
  - **Decomposition**: Breaking a large goal into smaller, manageable subtasks.
  - **Efficiency**: Avoid redundant or unnecessary steps.
  - **Scalability**: Enable handling of increasingly complex goals.

### Relationship Between Goals, Reasoning, and Tasks

- **Goal**: "Prepare a trip to Paris."
- **Reasoning**: "What steps are required? Book flight, reserve hotel, create itinerary."
- **Planning**: Creates a structured ordered list of subtasks:
  1. Find flights.
  2. Book accommodation.
  3. Research activities.
  4. Create a budget.

## 3. Key Concepts (10 minutes)

### 3.1 Classical vs. Modern Planning

**Classical:**
- STRIPS, symbolic planners.
- **Pros**: Logical rigor.
- **Cons**: Poor scalability, brittle in uncertain environments.

**Modern:**
- LLM-based planning: Use of GPT-like models for task breakdown.
- **Pros**: Flexible, contextual.
- **Cons**: Requires guardrails to avoid hallucinations.

### 3.2 Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN)

Break tasks into a tree structure:
- **Root** = Main goal.
- **Branches** = Subtasks.

**Example:**
```
Goal: Organize a conference.
Decomposition:
├── Venue booking
├── Speaker invitations
└── Marketing campaign
```

### 3.3 Reasoning Techniques

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Step-by-step reasoning.
- **Tree Search**: Explore multiple possible plans.
- **Heuristic reasoning**: Use heuristics to select optimal paths.

### 3.4 Task Decomposition Strategies

- **Rule-based**: Predefined templates for common goals.
- **LLM-driven**: Prompting a model to generate subtasks dynamically.
- **Hybrid**: Combine rules + LLM reasoning for reliability.

## 4. Practical Implementation (15 minutes)

We will build a basic planning pipeline that:
- Receives a high-level goal.
- Generates a structured plan.
- Decomposes into subtasks.
- Executes steps sequentially.

### 4.1 Architecture Diagram

```
User Goal → [Reasoning Engine] → [Planner] → [Subtask Executor]
```

- **Reasoning Engine**: LLM or heuristic logic.
- **Planner**: Converts reasoning into actionable steps.
- **Executor**: Executes subtasks in sequence or parallel.

### 4.2 Python Example

```python
import openai

# 1. Define Goal
goal = "Plan a weekend trip to Paris"

# 2. Generate plan using LLM
prompt = f"""
You are an AI planner. Break down the following goal into a sequence of subtasks:
Goal: {goal}
Format as a numbered list.
"""
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert planner."},
              {"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    temperature=0
)

plan = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
print("Generated Plan:\n", plan)

# 3. Store subtasks for execution
subtasks = [line for line in plan.split('\n') if line.strip()]
```

### 4.3 Hands-On Exercise

**Task:**
- Define a high-level goal: "Launch a digital marketing campaign for a new product."
- Generate a plan with at least 5 subtasks.
- Execute (simulate) each subtask by printing "Executing: [subtask]".

Save all files in `planning-task-decomposition`.

## 5. Best Practices (5 minutes)

- **Handle ambiguity**: Ask clarifying questions.
- **Flexibility vs. determinism**: Balance LLM creativity with rules.
- **State management**: Keep track of completed tasks.
- **Error handling**: Retry failed steps, avoid infinite loops.

## 6. Real-World Applications (3 minutes)

- **Workflow automation**: Business processes, DevOps pipelines.
- **Project management bots**: Breaking big deliverables into tasks.
- **Robotics**: Multi-step actions in dynamic environments.
- **Customer service**: Multi-turn problem resolution.

## 7. Summary & Key Takeaways (2 minutes)

- **Planning + reasoning** = Core of autonomous AI systems.
- **Task decomposition** enables efficiency and scalability.
- **Modern approach**: Combine LLMs + structured planning logic.
- **Applications**: From chatbots to enterprise automation.
