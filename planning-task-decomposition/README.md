# Planning and Task Decomposition in AI Agents

## 📚 **Module Overview**

This module covers the fundamental concepts of **planning and task decomposition** in AI agents - the core skills needed to create autonomous systems that can break down complex goals into manageable subtasks.

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

- Understand the difference between **reasoning** and **planning**
- Learn **Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN)** concepts
- Master **task decomposition strategies** (rule-based, LLM-driven, hybrid)
- Build a practical **planning pipeline** with goal → decomposition → execution
- Apply **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** reasoning techniques

## 🚀 **Key Concepts Covered**

### **Core Planning Concepts**
- **Classical vs Modern Planning**: STRIPS vs LLM-based approaches
- **Hierarchical Task Networks**: Tree-structured task breakdown
- **Reasoning Techniques**: CoT, Tree Search, Heuristic reasoning

### **Practical Implementation**
- **Architecture**: Goal → Reasoning Engine → Planner → Executor
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex goals into subtasks
- **Execution Flow**: Sequential and parallel task execution

### **Best Practices**
- **Ambiguity Handling**: Clarifying questions and edge cases
- **State Management**: Tracking task completion status
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic and infinite loop prevention

## 🛠️ **Exercise: Simple Task Planning System**

Build a basic AI planning system that:
1. **Receives a goal** (e.g., "Plan a weekend trip to Barcelona")
2. **Decomposes it** into 5-7 subtasks using OpenRouter API
3. **Executes the plan** by simulating each subtask
4. **Tracks progress** and completion status

## 📖 **Real-World Applications**

- **Workflow Automation**: Business processes, DevOps pipelines
- **Project Management**: Breaking deliverables into tasks
- **Robotics**: Multi-step actions in dynamic environments
- **Customer Service**: Multi-turn problem resolution

## 🎓 **Prerequisites**

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of API calls
- Familiarity with LLM concepts

## 📚 **Next Steps**

After completing this module, you'll be ready for:
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinating multiple planning agents
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Tree search and optimization
- **Production Planning**: Enterprise-grade planning systems
