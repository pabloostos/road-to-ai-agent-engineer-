# Masterclass: Memory & Context Management and Feedback Loops in AI Agents

## 1. Introduction (5 min)

Welcome to today's session on **Memory & Context Management and Feedback Loops in AI Agents**.

In this lecture, we will cover:

- What memory and context mean in AI agents and why they matter.
- Different memory types and their role in reasoning.
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement.
- Practical implementation with Python code.
- Real-world applications and best practices.

## 2. Why Memory and Context Matter (5 min)

AI agents often operate in multi-turn conversations or complex workflows. For these systems:

- **Context** = Information from previous steps that influences current decisions.
- **Memory** = The ability to store and retrieve relevant context for reasoning and planning.

### Without memory:
- Agents repeat questions.
- Lose track of goals.
- Cannot learn from past mistakes.

### Types of Memory

#### **Short-term memory**
- Context within a conversation (e.g., chat history).
- Stored in token window of the LLM.

#### **Long-term memory**
- Persistent across sessions.
- Often implemented with databases or vector stores.

#### **Episodic memory**
- Stores experiences and decisions for reasoning (e.g., reinforcement learning agents).

## 3. Challenges in Context Management (3 min)

- **Token limits in LLMs** â†’ cannot keep infinite history.
- **Noisy or irrelevant context** â†’ retrieval quality matters.
- **Scalability** â†’ larger context increases cost & latency.

## 4. Feedback Loops in AI (5 min)

### What is a feedback loop?
A mechanism where the agent evaluates its past performance and uses that evaluation to improve future outputs.

### Patterns

#### **Reinforcement**
- Adjust based on reward signals.

#### **Human-in-the-loop**
- User provides corrections.

#### **Self-evaluation**
- LLM critiques and improves its own output.

### Why Important?

- Reduces errors.
- Improves personalization.
- Enables continuous learning without retraining.

## 5. Key Concepts & Architectures (7 min)

### Memory Architectures

#### **Token-based context**
- Native LLM context window.

#### **External memory**
- Summarization of past interactions.
- Vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for semantic retrieval.

### Feedback Design

#### **Self-critique**
- LLM uses a secondary prompt to review its answer.

#### **Score-based improvement**
- Evaluate based on criteria (e.g., correctness, style).

#### **Iterative refinement**
- Generate â†’ Review â†’ Improve.

## 6. Practical Implementation (15 min)

We'll build:

- An agent that maintains context across turns.
- A feedback loop that improves responses.

### Step 1: Setup

```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

conversation_memory = []  # Stores context
```

### Step 2: Agent with Context

```python
def generate_response(user_input):
    conversation_memory.append(f"User: {user_input}")
    context = "\n".join(conversation_memory[-5:])  # last 5 turns for context
    
    prompt = f"""
    You are an assistant. Maintain context.
    Conversation so far:
    {context}
    Respond to the last user message appropriately.
    """
    
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]
    )
    
    reply = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    conversation_memory.append(f"Assistant: {reply}")
    return reply
```

### Step 3: Implement Feedback Loop

```python
def feedback_review(previous_output):
    review_prompt = f"""
    Review the following response for clarity and accuracy:
    "{previous_output}"
    Suggest improvements if necessary.
    """
    
    review = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": review_prompt}]
    )
    
    return review['choices'][0]['message']['content']

# Example
initial_response = generate_response("Explain quantum computing in simple terms.")
feedback = feedback_review(initial_response)
print("Feedback:", feedback)
```

### Step 4: Integrate Both

- After every response, run `feedback_review()`.
- Optionally regenerate improved response.

âœ… Save this code in `context-feedback-loops/`.

## 7. Hands-On Exercise (5 min)

### Task for Students:

- Define a goal: e.g., Plan a 3-day trip to Rome.
- Use the agent to:
  - Maintain context across multiple user queries.
  - Apply the feedback loop to refine the itinerary.
- Evaluate: Compare initial vs. improved responses.

## 8. Best Practices (3 min)

- **Avoid token overflow**: Summarize old conversations.
- **Efficient memory**: Use embedding search for relevant context.
- **Feedback quality**: Avoid overfitting to noisy corrections.
- **Cost control**: Limit iterations.

## 9. Real-World Applications (2 min)

- **Customer Support**: AI learns from corrections.
- **Project Management Bots**: Remember tasks & improve plans.
- **Autonomous Agents**: Continuous refinement without retraining.

## 10. Conclusion

Memory and feedback are the backbone of adaptive agents.
Combining them creates context-aware, self-improving AI systems.
