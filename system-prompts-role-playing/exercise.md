# System Prompts and Role Playing: Exercises

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Learn to design effective system prompts and implement role-playing techniques with Large Language Models using Hugging Face Inference API. You'll create AI personas, test their consistency, and build practical applications.

## ðŸ§© Exercise Overview

### Exercise 1: Basic System Prompt Design
Create a simple system prompt for a specific role and test its effectiveness with Hugging Face models.

### Exercise 2: Character Development
Design a detailed character with personality, background, and communication style.

### Exercise 3: Role Consistency Testing
Test your character's consistency across different scenarios and conversations.

### Exercise 4: Multi-Role System
Create a system that can switch between different roles seamlessly.

### Exercise 5: Production-Ready Implementation
Build a complete role-playing system with proper error handling and monitoring using Hugging Face API.

## ðŸ“‹ Detailed Instructions

### Exercise 1: Basic System Prompt Design

**Objective**: Create a simple but effective system prompt for a specific role using Hugging Face models.

**Tasks**:
1. Choose a role (e.g., "Helpful Assistant", "Expert Chef", "Travel Guide")
2. Design a system prompt with:
   - Clear role definition
   - Basic behavior guidelines
   - Response format preferences
3. Test the prompt with different user inputs using Hugging Face Inference API
4. Evaluate effectiveness and iterate

**Deliverables**:
- System prompt text
- Test results and observations
- Iteration notes

### Exercise 2: Character Development

**Objective**: Create a detailed character with rich personality and background.

**Tasks**:
1. Design a character with:
   - Detailed background story
   - Personality traits and quirks
   - Communication style and voice
   - Knowledge areas and expertise
   - Behavioral patterns and preferences
2. Implement the character using system prompts
3. Test character consistency with Hugging Face models
4. Document character guidelines

**Deliverables**:
- Character profile document
- System prompt implementation
- Character testing results

### Exercise 3: Role Consistency Testing

**Objective**: Ensure your character maintains consistency across different scenarios.

**Tasks**:
1. Create test scenarios covering:
   - Different conversation topics
   - Various user personalities
   - Edge cases and challenges
2. Run consistency tests using Hugging Face API
3. Identify and fix inconsistencies
4. Document improvement strategies

**Deliverables**:
- Test scenario list
- Consistency evaluation results
- Improvement recommendations

### Exercise 4: Multi-Role System

**Objective**: Build a system that can switch between different roles.

**Tasks**:
1. Design multiple related roles
2. Create role switching mechanisms
3. Implement context management
4. Test role transitions with Hugging Face models
5. Ensure smooth user experience

**Deliverables**:
- Multi-role system design
- Implementation code
- Transition testing results

### Exercise 5: Production-Ready Implementation

**Objective**: Build a complete, production-ready role-playing system using Hugging Face Inference API.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement proper error handling for Hugging Face API calls
2. Add monitoring and logging
3. Create user management features
4. Add safety and content filtering
5. Optimize for performance with Hugging Face models
6. Create comprehensive documentation

**Deliverables**:
- Complete system implementation
- Documentation and user guides
- Performance metrics
- Safety guidelines
