# System Prompts and Role Playing

A comprehensive module for learning how to design effective system prompts and implement role-playing techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) using Hugging Face Inference API.

## 🎯 Overview

This module explores:
- System prompt design principles
- Role-playing techniques and best practices
- Character development and personality crafting
- Context management and conversation flow
- Practical implementation with Hugging Face Inference API

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to the module
cd system-prompts-role-playing

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Hugging Face API key
# Get your API key from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
export HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run exercises
python src/main.py
```

## 🔑 API Setup

This module uses **Hugging Face Inference API** for LLM interactions:

1. **Create a Hugging Face account**: [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
2. **Get your API key**: Go to Settings → Access Tokens
3. **Set environment variable**: `export HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="your-key"`
4. **Free tier**: 30,000 requests/month
