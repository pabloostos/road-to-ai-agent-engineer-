# Monitoring Token Usage and Costs in LLM Applications

## 1. Introduction
As AI engineers, one of the key responsibilities in deploying large language models (LLMs) is **managing costs and resources** effectively. Tokens are the currency of LLM interactions, and monitoring their usage directly impacts both **performance** and **budget control**.

---

## 2. What Are Tokens?
Tokens are chunks of text (words, subwords, or characters) that LLMs use as input and output units.

- **Example:**  
  `"ChatGPT is amazing"` → might be tokenized as `[ "Chat", "G", "PT", " is", " amazing" ]` (5 tokens).  
- **Note:** Different models have different tokenization rules.

### 2.1 Token Calculation Examples
| Model | Tokenization Method | Example Tokens for `"Hello, world!"` |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| GPT-3.5 | Byte Pair Encoding | 3 tokens |
| GPT-4   | Byte Pair Encoding | 3 tokens |
| Claude  | Custom tokenizer   | 3 tokens (may differ in edge cases) |

## 3. Estimating Token Consumption Before Execution
Knowing how many tokens a query will use **before** sending it can save money and avoid exceeding limits.

**Methods:**
1. **Static Estimation:** Run your prompt through a tokenizer locally (e.g., `tiktoken`).
2. **Historical Averages:** Keep logs of similar queries and estimate.
3. **Budget Constraints:** Implement max token caps in API requests.

**Example in Python with `tiktoken`:**
```python
import tiktoken

enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4")
tokens = enc.encode("Hello, world!")
print(len(tokens))  # Output: 3
```

## 4. Real-Time Monitoring & Logging
### 4.1 Local Monitoring

Implement a wrapper function around API calls to:
- Count tokens
- Store request & response sizes
- Log timestamps

### 4.2 Cloud Monitoring

- Use provider dashboards (e.g., OpenAI usage page, Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch).
- Integrate billing APIs for automated alerts.

---

## 5. Relating Tokens to Costs

Most providers charge per 1,000 tokens.

**Formula:**
```
Cost = (Tokens / 1000) × Price per 1000 tokens
```

**Example (OpenAI GPT-4 8K, $0.03 / 1K input, $0.06 / 1K output):**
- Prompt: 500 tokens → $0.015
- Completion: 700 tokens → $0.042
- Total: $0.057

---

## 6. Tools & Libraries

- **tiktoken** – Token counting for OpenAI models.
- **OpenAI Billing API** – Track spending in near real time.
- **LangChain callbacks** – Monitor tokens per chain/agent call.
- **Custom dashboards** – Use Grafana or Tableau for visualization.

---

## 7. Real-World Applications
### 7.1 Chatbots
Monitor per-conversation token usage to avoid runaway costs.

### 7.2 Document Processing
Pre-chunk documents to fit within token limits.

### 7.3 AI Agents
Implement per-task token budgets.

---

## 8. Best Practices

- **Prompt Engineering:** Shorten prompts without losing meaning.
- **Batch Processing:** Send multiple queries in one API call when possible.
- **Caching:** Store and reuse results for identical queries.
- **Token Alerts:** Notify when daily budget exceeds a threshold.

---

## 9. Common Mistakes

- Ignoring output tokens in cost calculation.
- Not setting max_tokens, leading to unexpectedly long completions.
- Forgetting that system and instruction prompts also consume tokens.

---

## 10. Conclusion

Token and cost monitoring is a critical skill in AI engineering. It ensures your applications are scalable, predictable, and budget-friendly.
