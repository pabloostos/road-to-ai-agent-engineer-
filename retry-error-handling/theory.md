# Masterclass: Retry Mechanisms and Error Handling in AI Systems

## 1. Introduction

In production AI systems—especially those powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and APIs—failures are not just possible, they are inevitable.

Network glitches, API rate limits, malformed requests, or transient service outages can disrupt workflows.

To ensure reliability, resilience, and a smooth user experience, we need retry mechanisms and robust error handling.

## 2. Why Retries and Error Handling Matter

### Key benefits:

- **Reliability**: Automatically recovering from transient failures without user intervention.
- **Resilience**: Systems continue functioning even when parts fail.
- **User Experience**: Fewer interruptions or unexpected errors.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Avoids wasted API calls due to preventable failures.

## 3. Common Error Types in AI Workflows

| Error Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Network Issues** | Connectivity loss, DNS failures, or unstable connections | API call fails due to temporary internet outage |
| **Rate Limits** | API refuses requests due to exceeding allowed requests per time window | HTTP 429 from OpenAI API |
| **Timeouts** | Server does not respond in the given time | Long-running LLM query stalls |
| **Malformed Requests** | Incorrect JSON or invalid parameters | Missing required API field |
| **Model-Side Errors** | Internal model failure or unexpected output format | LLM returns incomplete JSON despite schema constraints |

## 4. Detecting and Classifying Errors

### HTTP Status Codes:

- **4xx**: Client errors (invalid request, rate limit)
- **5xx**: Server errors (internal failures)

### Exception Handling:

- `try/except` in Python to catch API exceptions

### Response Parsing:

- Checking JSON validity and required fields before processing

## 5. Retry Strategies

### 5.1 Fixed Delay

- Retry after a constant wait time
- Example: Retry every 2 seconds up to 3 times
- **Pros**: Simple
- **Cons**: Can overload a service if many retries happen simultaneously

### 5.2 Exponential Backoff

- Increase wait time exponentially after each attempt
- Example: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s
- **Pros**: Reduces pressure on failing service
- **Cons**: Slower recovery if the service becomes available quickly

### 5.3 Jitter (Randomization)

- Adds random variation to backoff delays to avoid synchronized retry spikes
- Often used with exponential backoff

## 6. Best Practices

- **Limit Retry Count** – Avoid infinite loops.
- **Respect Rate Limits** – Use API-provided retry-after headers if available.
- **Differentiate Between Errors** – Only retry on transient issues (timeouts, 5xx).
- **Logging & Monitoring** – Capture retry events, error messages, and timestamps.
- **Graceful Failover** – Switch to backup services or cached results when possible.
- **Configurable Parameters** – Allow tuning retries and delays without changing code.

## 7. Real-World Examples

- **Chatbots**: Automatic retries when the LLM API times out.
- **Data Processing Agents**: Retry on partial API outages to complete data pipelines.
- **Search Systems**: Failover to cached results when search API is unavailable.

## 8. Summary

- Retries handle transient failures; error handling manages all possible failure types.
- Use appropriate retry strategies based on error type.
- Combine retries with monitoring, logging, and failover for maximum resilience.
- Design configurable wrappers for easy reuse across projects.

## 9. Next Steps

In the exercise, you will implement a Python wrapper for an AI API that:

- Retries on network and server errors
- Logs failures and retries
- Allows configurable retry count and delay
